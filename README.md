This is a Trivia Game made by Toni De Gea.


I've made this game in Xcode 11.4 and it work in iOS 13. The databse that I implemented is CoreData because I think it's pretty straightforward for an app like this, just to save some user data like names, score and date. I didnt feel the need to use realm for a basic databse. I haven't used any external dependencies because I think the optiones that Apple provide are fantastic and they work really well.



Once you enter the main screen the API fecth the data to the labels and it shows in real time.
